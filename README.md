Created two sollutions for problem setted for Interns described bellow



 Do you know how the candy crush type games work? Write a function that receives 
 a string and plays a candy crush game with it - removes letters when there are
 3 or more the same letters in a row. We want this function to return what is left
 after all of the groups of letters have been removed.

Example:


Input string: AABBCCCCBDDDADB


After first round: AABBBADB


After second round: AAADB


After third round: DB


Output: DB
